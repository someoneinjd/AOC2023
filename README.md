# Advent of Code 2023

> These solutions are implemented using C++23.

## Compile && Run

```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja -B build/
cmake --build build --target day[01 | 02 | ...]
./build/day[01 | 02 | ...]
```

There are also some solutions writing in python for prototype validation in the `python` directory.

```shell
cd python
python3 day[09 | 10 | ...].py
```
